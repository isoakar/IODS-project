# Regression and model variation

This week I have revised the basics of **regression analysis**, and started to learn about how to both **perform** and **interpret** regression analysis in R. It has been fun! I am also getting the hang of using RMarkdown, which is great. But I need *loads* more practice, both in coding and in interpreting the results... :-)

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using
