# Regression and model variation

This week I have revised the basics of **linear and multiple regression analysis**, and started to learn about how to both **perform** and **interpret** these analyses in R. It has been fun, but not easy! I am also getting the hang of using RMarkdown, which is great. Here below you can see my data analysis on data JYTOPKYS2 dataset.

I have not managed to knit the chapter2.rmd yet, but please find my R code for data wrangling here:

and my attempt of data analysis steps here (interpretation is lacking still):
